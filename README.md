#### Who am I

I'm a French/Kiwi front-end developer.
I'm 34 years old and I'm currently living in Paraparaumu, NZ with my wife and two children.
I'm pretty much of a bookworm, and particularly enjoy mangas and fantasy literature. I also love all kinds of games: role-playing, card, board games, video games...you name it and I'm in! Morning gymgoer, I enjoy my daily session of weighlifting. I'm also an an amateur writer and a very keen miniature painter. I've also been vegetarian for the past 5 years, and vegan ðŸŒ± for the past 2 years.

I fell in love with New Zealand 20 years ago when Peter Jackson introduced the world to the culture, the landscapes, and the people of this beautiful country. I've been living in Wellington for 3 years now, working for the best finance company in NZ, [Jarden](https://github.com/jarden-digital).

I used to be a boilermaker in aeronautics. I hammered metal sheets for 7 years but I always knew it wasn't the right place for me. So I took evening classes for 2 years to obtain my High School degree. I always had a thing with computers so I decided to take a shot at it and try to make my way in this domain. I kept the evening class going for 3 more years in the university to obtain my Technology University degree in Informatics. In the same time I got my Technical Degree in Informatics and had my first work experience in this field. Finally, I went to the prestigious SUPINFO International University and 3 years later, here I am with my Master of Science in Informatics. Before leaving France, I've been working for the french government and for a major service company as a full-stack developer for 3 years.
